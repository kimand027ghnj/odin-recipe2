    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.[1] It is a staple food of traditional
        Italian cuisine.[2] Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with
        vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.[3] Usually the pasta is
        white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.[4] Spaghettoni is a thicker form of
        spaghetti, while spaghettini is a thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, while vermicelli refers to
        intermediate widths, varying between the United States and Italy.</p>
